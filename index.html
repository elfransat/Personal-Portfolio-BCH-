          <p>
            I am a 25 year old graduate from the United Kingdom persuing a
            career in Full Stack developement. My initial education is in
            Biomedical Science however since then I have realised that
            programming is my passion and have been persuing this for over a
            year. I started programming in Winter 2019 and was intially coding
            during my spare time to develop my skills however in Agust 2020 I
            started studying at Business College Helsinki full time allowing me
            to spend much more time developing my skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to develop the skills required to help me strive in
            Finland's growing software development industry. I have showcased
            some of the skills I have aquired and projects I have created during
            my studies on this portfolio as well as in my spare time
