            <p>
              I am a 25 year old graduate from the United Kingdom persuing a
              career in Full Stack developement. My initial education is in
              Biomedical Science however since then I have realised that
              programming is my passion and have been persuing this for over a
              year. I started programming in Winter 2019 and was intially coding
              during my spare time to develop my skills however in Agust 2020 I
              started studying at Business College Helsinki full time allowing
              me to spend much more time developing my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to develop the skills required to help me strive in
              Finland's growing software development industry. I have showcased
              some of the skills I have aquired and projects I have created
              during my studies on this portfolio as well as in my spare time
